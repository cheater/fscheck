ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

A consistency check for checking what files were made unavailable by bad
sectors.

Say you have a disk with bad sectors, you copy the partitions off it using
gddrescue. You don't know what files were broken or made unavailable by
directory inodes becoming corrupt. This program scans the directories, starting
with an initial set (for example the root directory or a list of specific
directories) and recurs into them, checking for errors. It does not list
erroneous files.

This program is used as a Python module which you import into the interpreter.
You instantiate the FSCheck class and feed it a gddrescue log. It uses debugfs
(the ext3 filesystem debugger interpreter, not the kernel debugging tool)
through a fairly finicky but surprisingly solid pexpect integration. It is very
slow because it needs to save out a file for every command! There is no python
interface for any debugfs-like functionality, alas.

It's fairly conservative with resources, even with 30k files scanned the Python
interpreter running it takes no more than 50 megabytes memory.
