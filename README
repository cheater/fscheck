ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

A consistency check for checking what files were made unavailable by bad
sectors.

Say you have a disk with bad sectors, you copy the partitions off it using
gddrescue. You don't know what files were broken or made unavailable by
directory inodes becoming corrupt. This program scans the directories, starting
with an initial set (for example the root directory or a list of specific
directories) and recurs into them, checking for errors. It does not list
erroneous files.

This program is used as a Python module which you import into the interpreter.
You instantiate the FSCheck class and feed it a gddrescue log. It uses debugfs
(the ext3 filesystem debugger interpreter, not the kernel debugging tool)
through a fairly finicky but surprisingly solid pexpect integration. It is very
slow because it needs to save out a file for every command! There is no python
interface for any debugfs-like functionality, alas.

It's fairly conservative with resources, even with 30k files scanned the Python
interpreter running it takes no more than 50 megabytes memory.

USAGE

You can either write a wrapper program around the fscheck module, or you can
use it from the interpreter. The general operation will look like so:

>>> import fscheck
>>> B = fscheck.BadBlocks(file('gddrescue.log'))
>>> C = fscheck.FSCheck(B, '/dev/sdf1')
>>> ' '.join(C.ls('/'))
'. .. lost+found var etc media cdrom' # and so on
>>> C.start_check(['/opt']) # check /opt and all subdirs

You can also interrupt start_check with Ctrl-C and then continue using
continue_check which you can again interrupt. You might want to do that to
check the state of the process, for example see what paths are queued up for
being checked or what files have been found to have errors in them.

If you want to dig deeper you can use the FSCheck.perform_check method which
is a coroutine/generator that yields control after each file that it tests. The
generator can be suspended at any time with Ctrl-C, it doesn't lose track of
the file being processed at the moment.

Finally, you can use the FSCheck.cmd method as a direct interface into debugfs.
It is relatively slow but better than nothing! Returns text, which you have to
parse yourself. The text generated by debugfs is usually easy to parse. It is
useful to make note of the amount of spaces between different parts.

You can also use BadBlocks as a python interface/parser for gddrescue logs.
